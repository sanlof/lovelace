                <h2>Dreadfully Delicious</h2>
                <p>Regardless of wether you prefer to sink your teeth directly into warm flesh or rather savour your meal out of a fancy crystal glass, our blood-bags are trained to be gentle, tasteful and discreet.</p>
                <p>As long as there are tables free, the restaurant is open for everyone, also those who aren't staying the night.</p>

                <h2>Tru:Blood</h2>
                <p>Staying in tune with contemporary trends, we also offer synthetic blood in the form of the somewhat tolerable Tru:Blood. This version is the latest one, being produced from renewable sources. Please be sure to specify this preference in your booking so that we can ensure to have the bloodtype of your choice in stock.</p>

                <p>For vampires who prefer to feed the old-fashioned way, der Keller is the place to go. This fascility is located in the basement, as untrained blood-bags must be consumed out of sight from other guests.</p>
                <p><em>Please note that this service is only available for guests who are staying at least a forthnight at the hotel.</em></p>

                <p>For non-vampire guests, we keep a smaller menu of nutrients. Garlic, though, is for obvious reasons prohibited throughout the hotel. In order to meet our non-vampire guests needs, please contact us at least one week in advance.</p>
