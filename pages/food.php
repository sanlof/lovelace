                <h2>Dreadfully Delicious</h2>
                <p>Regardless of wether you prefer to sink your teeth directly into warm flesh or rather savour your meal out of a fancy crystal glass, our blood-bags are trained to be gentle, tasteful and discreet.</p>
                <p>As long as there are tables and necks free, the restaurant is open for everyone, also those who aren't staying the night.</p>

                <p>Staying in tune with contemporary trends, we offer synthetic blood in the form of the somewhat tolerable Tru:Blood. We currently have the latest version in stock, one being produced from renewable sourcesâ€¦ For guests staying in luxury suites, we are happy to offer the most rare bloodtype, AB negative.</p>

                <p>For vampires who prefer to feed the old-fashioned way, der Keller is the place to go. This fascility is located in the basement, as untrained blood-bags must be consumed out of sight from other guests.</p>
                <p><em>Please note that this service is only available for guests who are staying at least a forthnight at the hotel.</em></p>

                <p>We understand that some of our guests want to bring their mortal pets with them. For these non-vampires, we keep a smaller menu of nutrients. Garlic, though, is for obvious reasons prohibited throughout the hotel.</p>
