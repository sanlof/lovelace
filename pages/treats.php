                <p>When one is undead yet destined to live forever, it is sometimes hard to remember what it is like to feel alive. Stake Trough the Heart is a unique near true death experience that may make even the most confident vampire fear for their eternal life. Our stakes are made of fine, harmless ivory that are thin enough to leave nothing more than a wound that heals in an instant, but the pain will feel just as real and may in return remind you to be grateful of your undead existence.</p>
